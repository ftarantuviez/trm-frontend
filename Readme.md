# Frontend Challenge Project

This repository contains two versions of a frontend challenge:

1. **frontend-js**: The original challenge as received
2. **frontend-ts**: A refactored solution with additional technologies

## Project Structure

- `frontend-js/`: Contains the original JavaScript implementation of the challenge
- `frontend-ts/`: Contains the refactored TypeScript solution with improvements

## frontend-js

The `frontend-js` directory contains the challenge as it was originally received. This version serves as a baseline and represents the initial implementation of the project.

## frontend-ts

The `frontend-ts` directory contains a refactored and improved version of the challenge. This solution includes:

- TypeScript implementation for improved type safety and developer experience
- Refactored code structure for better maintainability
- Additional technologies and best practices (e.g., state management, testing, etc.)

## Getting Started
